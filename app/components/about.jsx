<p>
  My journey into the world of technology began at a young age, fueled by a lifelong fascination with innovation. Despite exploring various fields and interests, it was in software development where I found my true calling. My coding odyssey commenced during my 11th grade, starting with C, and has since evolved into full-stack proficiency, encompassing advanced stacks and paradigms in the field.

<p>
  My architectural skills encompass Microservices, Clean Architecture, MVC Architecture, and integration with Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ, Celery, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and Databricks. I excel in database design and have experience with various services such as Razorpay, Stripe, PayPal, Chargebee, S3, Cloudinary, Twilio, SendGrid, Firebase, Node Mailer, Google Dialogflow, Tawk, Zego Cloud, OAuth 2.0, JWT, Postman, and JIRA.

  Committed to writing scalable, maintainable code, I thrive in fast-paced environments, driving projects from conception to deployment with a focus on CI/CD pipelines. My expertise extends to cloud services, ensuring seamless integration and performance optimization.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of work, I'm an avid learner, continuously expanding my skill set and contributing to the developer community through open-source projects and participation in coding competitions. Let's connect and explore how we can innovate together!
